## 🧠 What is it?

**Trading Simulator** is a web-based app that lets you simulate crypto or forex trades using leverage — without risking real money.

This is not a financial tool. It’s a **personal side project** created to:

- Practice emotional discipline
- Track strategy effectiveness
- Understand leverage dynamics
- Simulate P&L (Profit and Loss)

---

## 🎯 Features

✅ Open long positions with selected leverage  
✅ Set TP (Take Profit) and SL (Stop Loss)  
✅ Automatically closes trade and updates balance  
✅ Track open and closed trades  
✅ Visualize your P&L performance  
✅ No login, no signup, no backend  
✅ Fully free and private (data stays in localStorage)
